In Dvapara Yuga, Guruji had special powers to bless their shishay(students). If guruji used to like any shishay then he used to give them powers to fly, swim, run fast through their aashirwad. If they were unhappy from shishay then they use to take those special gift back by giving shraap.


  Write a program such that
  Ex:  

  ```arjun = Shishay.new(...)
  guru = Guru.new(....)
  guru.ashirwad(arjun, 'fly')```

  then

  ```arjun.fly```
   returns 'I am flying. I will defeat kaurav'

  ```guru.shraap(arjun, 'fly')```

  ```arjun.fly```
   returns 'I can't fly
